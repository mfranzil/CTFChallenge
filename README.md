# CTFChallenge

CTFChallenge is a simple Java-FX driven project made for a local cryptography CtF event. It supports up to 10 teams and 5 exercises.

## Features

* Addition of up to 10 teams, made up of two people, an unique ID, an unique team name and the score.
* Seamless removal and editing of teams, useful if the score has to be corrected during the match.
* Separate window with real-time updating scoreboard and buttons for editing font size
* Main window divided into three parts: a left part, used as a log area, a center part, containing radio buttons for setting whether a team captured the flag or not, a right part, containing combo boxes for giving extra points for teams arrived in first up to fifth place
* Customizable point system

## TODO

In the future, code will need to be refactored to accomodate an arbitrary number of teams and exercises.
